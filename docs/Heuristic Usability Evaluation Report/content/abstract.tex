This is a Heuristic Usability Evaluation report on our application Talio. A Heuristic Usability Evaluation report is a report where a design is evaluated alongside a set of heuristics. We made a prototype of our application and let this be evaluated according to a list of heuristics. We list the problems that were identified and which improvements we're carrying out to resolve the issues.
