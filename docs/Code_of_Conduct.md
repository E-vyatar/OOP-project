# Code of Conduct

### **Team name:**

Teletubbies (Group 17)

### **Shared team values:**

1. Respect - be respectful to others
2. Patience - not all of us may have experience or need more time than others
3. Communication - especially if you have issues with the work consor meeting the deadlines
4. Commitment - we want everyone to do their best and put effort into this project

### **Assignment description:**

Work together to make a to-do list application.

- Learn to work as a team and, hopefully, get to know each other.
- Try to achieve the learning objectives of the course.

### **Target or ambition level:**

We want at least a 7.0 (but we aim for a 10.0)

### **Products:**

#### What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents? What standards must the work submitted meet?

At the end of the project, we should have a finished product consisting of:

- The fully working application
- Documentation about the application
- Documentation about the teamwork
- Documentation of our progress in developing the app
- A product pitch video including a demonstration and slides about the whole project.
- Any other requirements for the project

Sharing files will be done using Google Drive in the first week(s) of the project. We should have migrated towards
GitLab by the time we start coding.
When we need to make new files, we can edit them simultaneously using Google Drive.
Work should meet the evaluation criteria listed in 'Norms & evaluations criteria'.

### **Planning:**

#### How do you ensure that each team member finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submit it to Brightspace on behalf of the project group?

When the final backlog has been published we'll create all the issues. During meetings, we'll create milestones for a week and we'll assign the relevant issues to people in a fairly distributed way. We'll also set up soft deadlines then, which everyone must meet.

Abigail will be responsible for the final deliverables. This only applies to group deadlines and not for individual assignments.

Decisions and conflicts will be dealt with as listed in `Decision-making' & 'Dealing with conflicts'.
Team decisions should be final with regard to the code. This is to avoid having to change everything we worked on so far for a small change in earlier code. An exception can be made if the team agrees upon it.

### **Behaviour:**

#### How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?

All members should follow the values listed in 'Shared team values'.
When we are in disagreement, we will discuss it. While discussing the issue, we will listen and let each other finish
talking. As a last resort, we could contact the TA to reach a consensus.
When someone is late for a meeting, without any communication beforehand, that person will have to bring cookies the
next time.

### **Communication:**

#### In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? Zoom, MS Teams? What information do you share via WhatsApp, e-mail, telephone?

Communication with the TA will be done on Mattermost & lab meetings.
Communication within the group will be done in several ways:

- Meetings are for project progression topics. (e.g. structure of the code, or what tasks everyone will have)
- Whatsapp will be used for any communication outside the meetings. (e.g. questions or last-minute messages). If in
  any case, something important has to be decided via WhatsApp, this will be documented.
- GitLab (eg. issues)

### **Commitment:**

#### How do you determine the quality of the work your group and each individual team member does? How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?

While working:

- stick to norms mentioned in 'Norms & evaluation criteria'.
- follow the expectations discussed in the meetings
- if anyone thinks a piece of work is of insufficient quality, they can communicate it to the person, as specified in '
  Communication'

Minute taker should:

- make minutes that are detailed and easy to read, and the contain everything discussed during a meeting
  Chair should:
- everyone is given reasonable time to speak
- create an agenda and share it with all members at least a day before each meeting

If there are any concerns about the work of either chair or the minute taker, they can be brought to attention during
the meeting (ideally after the agenda of the meeting has been concluded).

### **Division of tasks and roles:**

#### A decision must be made as to who will be the chairperson and minute-taker of your group. How do you determine this? Do the roles change over the course?

We will rotate the minute take and chairperson roles each week (based on the alphabetical order of last names).
We will divide tasks amongst each other each week/meeting, depending on the tasks.
The deadlines should be set before the next meeting, or for the end of the week - as long as the given amount of time is
sufficient to complete the task with high enough quality.

### **Meetings:**

#### How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?

In preparation for the TA meeting (Tuesdays during labs) & Weekly update meeting (Friday 16:00-16:30, Subject to change
based on everyone's schedule):

- Everyone needs to read the agenda and minutes of the previous meetings.
- Everyone should have finished their tasks with sufficient quality.
- Chair should have prepared and disclosed the meeting agenda.

### **Decision-making:**

#### How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

We make decisions based on a majority vote:

- Everyone should have time to make a case for their decision.
- If the vote comes out to a split, Romir will decide.
- Decisions should be final in general, so we won't have to rewrite the code shortly before the final deadline. An
  exception is if we as a group agree.

### **Dealing with conflicts:**

#### How do you handle conflicts within the group?

We handle conflicts by involving the whole group. We will discuss the issue and think of solutions. These solutions must
be fair for both parties.
If anyone gets in a fight, the parties involved may be subject to the cookie punishment mentioned in 'Consequences'.

### **Guidance:**

#### What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant's guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?

The TA should not be involved in our conflicts but may step in case of useful feedback or more serious issues (
generally avoid bothering the TA).
We follow the agenda template for the feedback given in meetings .

### **Consequences:**

#### What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?

If an agreement is broken, depending on the case (based upon whether they have a good excuse and/or how many problems it caused), consequences will be decided by the others on the team. An option can be that that person should bring cookies or another form of food that the others will generally
enjoy (should also include a vegan option).
In other cases, when person A's work had to be done by person B, person A has to do additional work to compensate for the fact that person B had to do their work (and person B has to done less then).
If and only if people break agreements multiple times and don't improve their behaviour after this having been voiced in meetings, we'll address the issue with the TA.

### **Success factors:**

#### What makes your team a dream team?

1. Focus
2. Commitment
3. Sheer will
4. Communication
5. Luck

### **Norms & evaluation criteria:**

#### You will evaluate your own and each other's work in this project. Discuss and write down your team criteria. You need at least five different criteria.

1. Punctuality - all deadlines should be met
2. Communicating progress - the team should be aware of how you are doing
3. Display effort - even if you're not sure how to do something, attempt it
4. Consider feedback - should be included in your work
5. Ensure quality -clean, readable, and well tested and documented work (checkstyle)
6. Flavour and quality of cookies - important for cookie rule mentioned in 'Consequences'

### Gitlab Etiquette
Any merge needs two people's approval. You are not allowed to approve your own merge request. If your code is relevant to someone else's work, you should assign them to approve the merge request, otherwise it's a matter of who sees it first. 
We're gonna work with a main and dev branch. We'll make merge changes into dev and once a week we merge dev into main. This last merge requires everyone's approval.
