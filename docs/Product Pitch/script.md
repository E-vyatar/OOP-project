## Introduction

Romir: We all struggle with organizing our day-to-day lives, and the unending barrage of deadlines and assignments 
doesn’t make it any easier. As students of the TU, we find ourselfs constantly crushed by the sheer weight of our tasks.
Don’t you wish there was a solution?

Kaj: Introducing: Talio. The solution to all your productivity woes. Designed with students, for students, by students. 
Talio is your ticket to a more organized world. With talio, you can keep track of your daily tasks, shopping lists, 
reminders, appointments and so much more. Let’s take a closer look.


## Features

Abi: Say you’ve decided to throw a party on the weekend. You’re going to need some planning. Let’s create a board 
(Groceries). It’s that easy. We’re going to need groceries. Click on this button to create a new list, give it a name 
(Grocery list)... and add some items (4 food & drink). Let’s add another list, of potential cake choices (Cakes)... 
and add some favorites (add two cards). Yum! But there’s a mistake. Not to worry, you can just edit the card and fix it 
in no time.


Evy: Now, let’s create another board, this time for party planning (create a board). Let’s add a list of friends, 
but this one took some fries from you without asking last week, so they’re not invited (delete card). How about what 
movies to watch (cards)? Maybe you decide to watch this one first (drag and drop).

Finn: And now, you decide to share your master plan with some friends. With Talio, real-time collaboration is built 
right in, so your friends can make changes all while sitting at home (Finn on discord?). What makes Talio unique?

Romir: Talio is lightweight, simple, and focused on the tools you need to keep things organized. Anyone can get started 
with it in just a couple of clicks. We designed the interface to be intuitive to use while still aesthetically pleasing.
Now let’s take a look under the hood. 

## Technical overview

Kaj: Talio consists of a client and a server application. The client communicates with the server to get the latest 
data, and saves any changes made to your Boards.Our unique API makes synchronization across clients fast and error-free.
Client requests happen over HTTP and server updates over sockets. All changes are reflected in the database, which 
ensures data persistence.

## Future
Rares: In the future, we plan to add many shiny new features to Talio. A password protection system to ensure nobody 
steals your next big idea, quick links to make sharing boards easier, keyboard shortcuts to improve your workflow, 
as well as more detailed and descriptive cards. 

## Conclusion

Rares: With Talio, you can take your productivity to the next level and crush those tasks instead of being crushed by 
them yourself.
