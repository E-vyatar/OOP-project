Minute taker: Finn 

Mark: Pass

Feedback: -


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Make sure that for the next meetings the agenda is available in the repo (ideally on main).
* Can we agree to have this on main Tuesday morning at latest?
* Agenda followed the template, I really like how you adapted the template and tranfered it to .md
* I liked that you added some questions in the Question round section.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Notes were merged in the agenda.
* I do not see that many notes regarding the topics/feedback discussed during the meeting
* Good that you included a list of tasks for each member


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback:
* I think that for this week, the chair performance was excellent, regarding the topics covered, 
their number and also the time that we spend on each item. When you see that the discussion is too long,
it is good to stop it and continue with the next action item. You managed to do it very well during the meeting.
* It was also great that this time you spend more time discussing/ asking questions, rather than working on
an assignment.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
* It was great to see that you took ownership of the meeting. Most people were active.
* I like that you raise your hand when someone wants to talk.
* Sometimes, it felt that some people talked more than the others (even though the others also
raised their hand signaling that they wanted to say something). Try to keep a balance: if someone
did not say something in a while, let them speak first.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback:
* Not applicable for this week, but keep this in mind for the future weeks.
