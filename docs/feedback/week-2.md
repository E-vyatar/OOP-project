# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Kai
Minute taker: Abi

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Very good. Make sure that for every meeting the chair and minute taker are aware of their roles beforehand.


#### Agenda

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* This was the first meeting for which I have requested the agenda. From now on make sure you upload them on GitLab,
in the docs directory. It was great that you sent the agenda 1 day before the meeting. 
* Content: make sure that you plan the meeting within the timeframe, so instead of coming up with topics and then add timestamps
to them, please consider that the meeting is only 45 minutes long. So if everything that you want to talk about takes 1h based on your planing,
you can either prioritize some items, or reduce the time that you plan to spend on certain topics. Also, only create the agenda for the meeting with me,
so don't mix this meeting schedule with your own meetings.
* Content: Make sure you prioritize questions/ topics that you want to discuss with me as well. During the provious meeting we spent quite some time
working on the Backlog.
* Content: If you have questions during the meeting, can you make sure that you add these in the agenda so I can prepare a bit before with the answers.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Insufficient/ Does not apply

Feedback: 
* The previous week you did not have a minute taker (which is fine). From now on it is important that the Minute Taker posts the notes in a nice format,
easy to read in the team repository.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Most topics were covered, the timings as mentioned earlier were off, so work a bit on that (it is important to plan your meetings well
as in the next weeks we will have even more topics to discuss about/ you'll have more questions + also decide what do you want to do in the meeting with me).


#### Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
* Everyone was active and listened to the others carefully during the meeting which is very important.
* It is great that there was never a time when I had to take over the meeting.
