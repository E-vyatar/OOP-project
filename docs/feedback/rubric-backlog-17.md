### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: 
* The mocks section is not relevant here as the images are from the slides (good that you referenced that), but I will only look at the things that
you wrote/created.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback:
* You have all mentioned sections for this assignment.
* Stakeholders: for this part, I see that you identified ALL stakeholders, but if you read the assignment you need to write about "stakeholders that you have identified as application users",
so in this case User + Host it's enough (a small explanation for each would have been nice as well in this section, instead of in the terminology - make sure you place the info in the relevant sections).

### Epics

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* You have an epic for the "basic app", so it's great, but for the advanced requirements I wanted to see them separated a bit more,
as presented in the lecture (eg: you talk about boards, and tags - maybe you can group these user stories into epics - see assignment description:
"high-level epics that represent the features of the application (...) they form subsections").
* Make sure you read the EPICS subsection of the assignment carefully and identify exactly what they are asking for.
* See slides 18,24 from requirements-engineering-slides.pdf
* You don't need to prioritize them using the MoSCoW anymore, but keep in mind that the epics need to be ordered in
a prioritized manner (-> you can deduce this from the MoSCoW)

### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback:
* Clarity: some user stories are formulated a bit strange/are incomplete (eg: "A card consists only of a title"; "to move (drag & drop)", "lists on the board and in this way change their order, so I can...")
* Structure: most requirements follow the who/what/why structure, but it is missing for some of them.
* Completeness: After you identify the epics, it will be easier to see that some of them are missing some user stories to make the workflow of the application complete (eg: you talk about a user creating 
multiple boards, but you don't clearly specify that the user can also join multiple boards; you create/add tags, but what if I want to remove/change one?).

### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
* Size of the user stories is small enough that the acceptance criteria are clear
