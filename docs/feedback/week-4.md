# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Finn
Minute taker: Rares
Mark: Pass

Feedback: -


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
* Agenda on Git before the meeting (that s great!!)
* Make sure that you are consistent with the names of the agendas, keep it agenda_week_X
* I really like the "If we have time" point. Sometimes meetings finish faster than expected and it
is always good to have some extra things to discuss (instead of ending the meeting early)

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
* I really like that the notes are very detalied and that you merge it with the agenda.
* Tip: make sure that it is clear which are the notes and which is the test of the agenda. (maybe just add "Notes"
before the notes text.)
* Tip2: You merge the minutes with the agenda anyways, why keep 2 separate documents in 2 different folders? Just 
update the agenda one and remove all duplicate documents.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* Top: I really like that you decided to go through all you agenda points before the "add issues" + split tasks activity.
* Tip: Sometimes it felt like the other teammates were moderating the meeting more. As a chair, you can decide
when to move to the next topic if you think that the discussion is too long or if you won't be able to cover all points.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
* Everyone is involved in the meeting and it really looks like you have "great team chemestry".
* It was also great to see you split the tasks. (I would have expected the chair to be more involved in splitting,
but that is ok). It is good that you went to all issues and always asked who wanted to take the task.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: 
* No code in repo when the meeting started. I would like to see everyone working on their tasks and presenting
their updates starting from the next meeting. I expect to always see some frontend and backend updates.
