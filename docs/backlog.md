## User Stories

### Epic 1: MVP (In order of priority)

As a **User** I want:

- to view the board (without registration), so I can see the contents of the board
- to create/remove a list within a board, so I can create various categories for my cards (first mock)
- to add/remove cards to lists, so I can add new TO DO’s when I have a new task I need to do and remove them in case
  they turn out to not be necessary (first mock)
- A card consists only of a title
- to move (drag & drop)
- cards up and down in a list, so I can prioritize my TO DO’s.
- cards between lists, so I can change the status of cards when I start working on them or am finished with them.
- lists on the board and in this way change their order, so I can put the lists in a logical order and have the more
  commonly used lists more readily accessible.
- to see all changes in real time for every user, so you can collaborate more easily and don’t have to keep hitting a
  refresh button to see if another user has done something

### Epic 2: Advanced Requirements (In order of priority)

As a **User** I want:

- to view boards using a key (and password), so I can work on multiple boards which can be for different things
- to create new boards and get that board’s key, so I can separate tasks for different projects for better
  organization (e.g. separate work and private chores). This way I can also make personalized boards.
- to add a password to a board, so I can have private boards.
- to add details to a card  (second mock)
- adding a description, so I can elaborate on what I mean with a task
- add a (potentially nested) task list, so I can split the tasks into sub-tasks to make cards seem more doable and
  encourage progress.
- to use tags
- Create tags, so I can have more flexibility in describing and organizing cards
- Add tag to card, so I can specify the type of task it is and be able to retrieve it more easily later
- Filter by tags (only cards with a certain tag will be visible), so I can more quickly find a specific card I’m looking
  for and/or to have a better overview of cards related to another card
- to customize boards
- add background color, to make them look nicer and/or to have a visual separation between boards
- Specify tag color, to be able to visually distinguish between different tags for better organization
- to use keyboard shortcuts, to have a more efficient workflow
- to protect write access to a board with a password, so I can share what I’m doing without risking someone destroying
  my board

As a **host** I want:

- to stop/restart the server, so I can fix potential glitches and/or perform updates
- change/reset passwords of boards, so I can help people who are locked out of their own board
- delete boards, so I can comply with local laws and/or remove offensive content
